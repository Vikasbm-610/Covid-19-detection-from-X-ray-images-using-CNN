# Covid-19-detection-from-X-ray-images-using-CNN
Project OverviewThis project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The model aims to classify X-ray images into COVID-19 positive or negative categories, assisting in rapid screening.

Key Features- Deep Learning Model: Utilizes CNN architecture for image classification.
- Dataset: Uses publicly available X-ray image datasets (e.g., COVID-19 Radiography Database).
- Implementation: Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras libraries.
- Metrics: Evaluation includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for performance assessment.

Repository Structure- data/: Contains dataset information or sample images.
- models/: Saved CNN model architectures and weights.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- src/: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation.
- results/: Model performance metrics and output visualizations.

Technologies Used- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- Chest X-ray images for COVID-19 detection

Goals- Develop an efficient CNN model for COVID-19 detection.
- Evaluate model performance on test datasets.
- Potential application in medical imaging for rapid screening.
